# What is a Curried Function?

A curried function is a function that takes exactly one parameter while taking multiple parameters. 

It is useful for re-using, and partially using. 



# Example of the Curried function(.js)

This code has been regenerated by referring to the next lecture([Ref](https://www.inflearn.com/course/%ED%95%A8%EC%88%98%ED%98%95-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%98%EB%B0%8D/lecture/6779?tab=note&speed=2))

This code is an example of a **curry function** in **functional programming**. In other words, it is the code that the function is used while creating the other stacked-formed function.

* **'add' function** : stacked-formed function which is operated only when inputted two-variables.

## Codes(.js)

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>category_classification</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>

function _curried_func(f){
    return function(i1_var) {
        return function(i2_var){
            return f(i1_var, i2_var)
        }
    }
}

var add = _curried_func(function(i1,i2){return i1+i2;});
var add1 = add(1);

// ↓ 'add10'fuction is started rightly after '2' is inputted.
console.log(add1(2));
// ↓ the function is wating until (2) is inputted to the 'add' function
console.log(add(1)(2));
// we can see the same results. 

</script>
</body>
</html>
```
