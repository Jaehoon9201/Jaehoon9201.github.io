## Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT)

It decomposes of a function(signal) with basic functions(signal) which are orthogonality. 

When considering a matrix-vector representation, inner product of each rows must be 'zero'. (If the row contains complex number, one of the row should be conjugated. )

## Relations with other spectrum analysis methods

Below methods are all similar in that they are used for decomposing a signal. 

But  target signal's  form of period and frequency are somewhat different. 

* ##### Fourier series 
  Applying to continuous-time signal, assuming period T

* ##### Fourier transform

  Applying to continuous-time signal, assuming aperiodic

* ##### Discrete-time Fourier Transform

  Applying to discrete-time signal, assuming aperiodic
